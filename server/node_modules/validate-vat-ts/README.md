# Validate European VAT number

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/viruschidai/validate-vat-ts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/viruschidai/validate-vat-ts)

[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/validate-vat-ts.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validate-vat-ts)

The original [validate-vat](https://github.com/viruschidai/validate-vat) lib was written in CoffeeScript and did not update for many years. This rewrites it in TypeScript. This lib is basically calling web service provided by VIES (at http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/checkVatService.wsdl) for VAT number validation. It can only be used in node env, if you want to call the VIES service from browser, you probably need proxy it through your server.

## What is a VAT number?
A value added tax identification number or VAT identification number (VATIN) is an identifier used in many countries, including the countries of the European Union, for value added tax purposes.

## Get started
```bash
npm install validate-vat-ts
```
In your code
```javascript
import validateVat, {ViesValidationResponse} from 'validate-vat-ts';

const consumer = async () => {
  try {
    const validationInfo: ViesValidationResponse = await validateVat(CountryCodes.Germany, "12323");
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
}
```
For more usages, please refer to the [test file](./src/index.spec.ts).

##### Returns
when valid
```javascript
{
  countryCode: 'xx',
  vatNumber: 'xxxxxxxxx',
  requestDate: '2013-11-22+01:00',
  valid: true,
  name: 'company name',
  address: 'company address'
}

#### Exceptions
